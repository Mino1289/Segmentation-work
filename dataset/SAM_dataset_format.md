We save masks per image as a json file. It can be loaded as a dictionary in python in the below format.

```python
{
    "image"                 : image_info,
    "annotations"           : [annotation],
}

image_info {
    "image_id"              : int,              # Image id
    "width"                 : int,              # Image width
    "height"                : int,              # Image height
    "file_name"             : str,              # Image filename
}

annotation {
    "id"                    : int,              # Annotation id
    "segmentation"          : dict,             # Mask saved in COCO RLE format.
    "bbox"                  : [x, y, w, h],     # The box around the mask, in XYWH format
    "area"                  : int,              # The area in pixels of the mask
    "predicted_iou"         : float,            # The model's own prediction of the mask's quality
    "stability_score"       : float,            # A measure of the mask's quality
    "crop_box"              : [x, y, w, h],     # The crop of the image used to generate the mask, in XYWH format
    "point_coords"          : [[x, y]],         # The point coordinates input to the model to generate the mask
}
```

Image ids can be found in sa_images_ids.txt which can be downloaded using the above [link](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything-downloads/) as well.

To decode a mask in COCO RLE format into binary:

```
from pycocotools import mask as mask_utils
mask = mask_utils.decode(annotation["segmentation"])
```

See [here](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/PythonAPI/pycocotools/mask.py) for more instructions to manipulate masks stored in RLE format.
